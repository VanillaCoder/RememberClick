### Overview

RememberClick is a memory game with a simple goal: There are 15 tiles, each one displaying a unique character from a TV series. Click each character's tile once and you win! Click the same character twice, and you lose!

There is a hidden twist integrated into the game which I believe increases the difficulty, you'll have to play to find out! This fun little effect does make the game unplayable on mobile though so beware!
